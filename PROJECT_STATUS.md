Last Updated: 2026-02-13
Phase: MVP02 – Runtime Stabilization

---

## 🎯 Mission

To build a **verifiable, rule-driven COBOL→C# migration framework**
designed for real-world legacy modernization projects.

This repository is not a simple code converter.
It is a structured migration methodology prototype.

---

## 🔍 Current Focus

- Stabilizing UNSTRING implementation
- Implementing INSPECT support
- Improving TODO-based missing construct detection
- Expanding unit test coverage

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Runtime:
- `apps/backend/src/CobolMvpRuntime/`

Tests:
- `apps/backend/tests/CobolMvpRuntimeTests/`

Verification:
- `tools/verifier/extract-todos.ps1`

Documentation:
- Rule definitions
- Coverage matrix
