# COBOL to C# Migration Framework

A **practical repository for systematic COBOL to C# (.NET) migration** focused on 
**transformation rules**, **audit materials**, and **verification processes** 
that can be continuously developed and refined on GitHub.

This repository follows the principle of **not rushing into building conversion tools**. 
Instead, it prioritizes **establishing transformation rules and audit loops first**, 
then gradually progressing toward automation and semi-automation.

The framework particularly focuses on **preventing migration accidents** in 
COBOL-specific challenging areas:

- REDEFINES
- OCCURS / OCCURS DEPENDING ON  
- COPYBOOK
- Aggregation, digits, signs, and edited fields

---

## Objectives

- Develop **business-ready deliverables for sales and proposals** 
  in COBOL → C# replacement projects
- Minimize migration risks (specification misunderstandings, data inconsistencies, migration gaps) 
  through **audit and verification mechanisms**
- Build a foundation of rule sets, samples, and verification procedures 
  for gradual expansion into **semi-automated conversion tools**

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Transformation Rule Set
- Numbered rules (R-001...) for converting COBOL syntax and conventions to C#
- Each rule includes:
  - Scope of application
  - Transformation approach
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Before/After examples
  - Notes and unresolved issues

### 2. Audit Samples
- Test materials for verifying rule comprehensiveness and validity
- Managed sets of COBOL + Copybook + input data + expected results

### 3. Verification Framework
- Validation of correctness after file → DBMS migration
- Approaches, procedures, and tool strategies for record counting, 
  aggregate comparison, and difference detection

### 4. Migration Support Tools (Future Extension)
- Rule-based conversion assistance
- Static analysis
- Check and test harness capabilities

## Version Management Policy (Tags)

This repository **fixes implementation and verification milestones with Git tags**.

- Naming Convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_NN_Implement` (e.g., `2026-02-11_01_Implement`)

- Examples:
  - `2026-02-03_01_Implement`
    - Snapshot of OrderValidation implementation and related rules/audit deliverables

The purpose is to make it reproducible on a tag-by-tag basis:
- "What was finalized at this point"
- "How far verification had progressed"
